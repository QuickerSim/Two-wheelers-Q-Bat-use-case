# Heat transfer in a e-motorbike’s battery pack modeled in Q-Bat 
[![View Battery pack Simulink model with Q-Bat and Simscape on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/)

This repository shows how to model transfer in a e-motorbike’s battery pack in Q-Bat from QuickerSim. The model consists 102 groups of 21700 Li-ion cells (17s6p), terminals, connectors, holders and casing and is connected to a reduced-order model (ROM) to model heat transfer in 3D geometry.
