# Two-wheelers-Q-Bat-use-case

This repository shows how to model heat transfer in an e-motorbikeâ€™s battery pack in Q-Bat from QuickerSim. The model consists 102 groups of 21700 Li-ion cells (17s6p), terminals, connectors, holders and casing and is connected to a reduced-order model (ROM) to model heat transfer in 3D geometry.
